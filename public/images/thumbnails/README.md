# Category Thumbnails

This directory contains thumbnail images for each portfolio category.

## Current Placeholder Thumbnails

The following SVG placeholders are currently in place:

1. **travel-hospitality.jpg** - Blue gradient with travel icons
2. **education-wellness.jpg** - Green gradient with education icons
3. **events.jpg** - Red gradient with event icons
4. **media-brands.jpg** - Purple gradient with media icons
5. **lifestyle.jpg** - Orange gradient with lifestyle icons

## Replacing Placeholders with Real Images

To use your own custom thumbnails:

1. **Prepare your images:**
   - Recommended size: 1280x720px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Keep file size under 500KB for fast loading

2. **Replace the files:**
   - Simply replace the existing `.jpg` files with your own images
   - Keep the exact same filenames:
     - `travel-hospitality.jpg`
     - `education-wellness.jpg`
     - `events.jpg`
     - `media-brands.jpg`
     - `lifestyle.jpg`

3. **The thumbnails will automatically be used** when you select the corresponding category in the admin panel

## Notes

- These thumbnails are automatically assigned based on the category you select
- No need to upload thumbnails for each video - just select the category!
- Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
